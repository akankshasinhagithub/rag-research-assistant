In March 2023, shortly after ChatGPT was  launched, the GPT 4 is available as final version. GPT -4  builds on the success of its pre decessors, GPT -3 [11] and  GPT -2 [12]. These models have shown significant  improvements in their ability to understand and generate  natural languages. With 175 billion parameters, GPT -3 sets  new standards for several natural language processing tasks  [13",

METHOD   This research was designed based on the case study  methodology proposed by Yin [33]. The exploratory case  study method was preferred to investigate and interpret the  usage areas and experiences  of users on the Auto -GPT project,  which is available on the GitHub platform, comprehensively  and deeply. In the relevant literature, researchers have v",

A case study is a method th at examines a single  situation or event longitudinally, systematically collecting  data and examining what happens in real -world settings. Yin  [37] defines case study as a research method used when the  research focuses on \"how\" and \"why\" questions, when the   researcher has little or no control over the events, when you  study the event ",
  "ontrol over the events, when you  study the event or phenomenon within its natural life  framework, when the link between the event and real life is  not clear enough. According to Yin [38], one of the features  that distinguishes  a case study from other designs is that it is  combined with an existing theory and, depending on its  outputs, three types of case studies are defined as exploratory,  descriptive, and explanatory. An exploratory case study  design is conducted to investigat e a new ",
  " study  design is conducted to investigat e a new situation, a topic that  has not yet been sufficiently researched, and to fill the gap in  the literature [39].

These themes reflect the most important ideas and experiences  shared by users.   4. Review and Refine Themes : The identified themes  were reviewed and refined to ensure that they accurately  represented the data. This process aims to verify that the  themes are supported by coded data, and that there are clear",

Identifying and Naming Themes : The final step was  to create clear and unambiguous descriptions for each theme  and associated subthemes to identify and name the themes.   V. FINDINGS   Themes were derived from the codes in the thematic  content analysis.  Thus, 21 themes were identified. The themes  were sorted into four categories based on their common  characteristics.

They can do so without any access to an external memory, as a parameterized implicit knowledge base [ 51,52]. While this development is exciting, such models do have down- sides: They cannot e",

Hybrid models that combine parametric memory with non-parametric (i.e., retrieval-based) memories [ 20,26,48] can address some of these issues because knowledge can be directly revised and expanded, and accessed knowledge can be inspected and interpreted.

The retriever (Dense Passage Retriever [ 26], henceforth DPR) provides latent documents conditioned on the input, and the seq2seq model (BART [ 32]) then conditions on these latent documents together with the input to generate the output. We marginalize the latent documents with a top-K approximation, either on a per-output basis (assuming the same document is responsible for all tokens) or a per-token bas",
  " is responsible for all tokens) or a per-token basis (where different documents are responsible for different tokens). Like T5 [ 51] or BART, RAG can be ﬁne-tuned on any seq2seq task, whereby both the generator and retriever are jointly learned. There has been extensive previous work proposing architectures to enrich systems with non-parametric memory which are trained from scratch for speciﬁc tasks, e.g. memory networks [ 64,55], stack- augmented networks [ 25] and memory layers [ 30]. In contr",

Crucially, by using pre-trained access mechanisms, the ability to access knowledge is present without additional training. Our results highlight the beneﬁts of combining parametric and non-parametric memory with genera- tion for knowledge-intensive tasks —tasks that humans could not reasonably be expected t",

For knowledge-intensive generation, we experiment with MS-MARCO [ 1] and Jeopardy question generation, and we ﬁnd that our models generate responses that are more factual, speciﬁc, and diverse than a BART baseline. For FEVER [ 56] fact veriﬁcation, we achieve results within 4.3% of state-of-the-art pipeline models which use strong retrieval supervision.

As shown in Figure 1, our models leverage two components: (i) a retriever p\u0011(zjx)with parameters \u0011that returns (top-K truncated) distributions over text passages given a query xand (ii) a generator p\u0012(yijx;z;y 1:i\u00001)parametrized 1Code to run experiments with RAG has been open-sourced as part of the ",

To train the retriever and generator end-to-end, we treat the retrieved document as a latent variable. We",
  "at the retrieved document as a latent variable. We propose two models that marginalize over the latent documents in different ways to produce a distribution over generated text. In one approach, RAG-Sequence , the model uses the same document to predict each target token. The second approach, RAG-Token , can predict each target token based on a different document. In the following, we formally introduce both models and then describe the p\u0011andp\u0012components, as well as the training and decoding pro",
  "mponents, as well as the training and decoding procedure. 2.1 Models RAG-Sequence Model The RAG-Sequence model uses the same retrieved document to generate the complete sequence . Technically, it treats the retrieved document as a single latent variable that is marginalized to get the seq2seq probability p(yjx)via a top-K approximation. Concretely, the top K documents are retrieved using the retriever, and the generator produces the output sequence probability for each document, which are then m",

This allows the generator to choose content from several documents when producing an answer. Concretely, the top K documents are retrieved using the retriever, and then the generator produces a distributio",
  "ver, and then the generator produces a distribution for the next output token for each document, before marginalizing, and repeating the process with the following output token, Formally, we deﬁne: pRAG-Token (yjx)\u0019NY iX z2top-k(p(\u0001jx))p\u0011(zjx)p\u0012(yijx;z;y 1:i\u00001) Finally, we note that RAG can be used for sequence classiﬁcation tasks by considering the target class as a target sequence of length one, in which case RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token are equivalent. 2.2 Retriever: DPR The retrieval component",
  "valent. 2.2 Retriever: DPR The retrieval component p\u0011(zjx)is based on DPR [26]. DPR follows a bi-encoder architecture: p\u0011(zjx)/exp\u0000 d(z)>q(x)\u0001 d(z) =BERTd(z);q(x) =BERTq(x) where d(z)is a dense representation of a document produced by a BERT BASE document encoder [8], andq(x)a query representation produced by a query encoder , also based on BERT BASE. Calculating top-k (p\u0011(\u0001jx)), the list ofkdocumentszwith highest prior probability p\u0011(zjx), is a Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) problem, which",
  "Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) problem, which can be approximately solved in sub-linear time [ 23]. We use a pre-trained bi-encoder from DPR to initialize our retriever and to build the document index. This retriever was trained to retrieve documents which contain answers to TriviaQA [ 24] questions and Natural Questions [29]. We refer to the document index as the non-parametric memory . 2.3 Generator: BART The generator component p\u0012(yijx;z;y 1:i\u00001)could be modelled using any encoder-decode",
  "y 1:i\u00001)could be modelled using any encoder-decoder. We use BART-large [ 32], a pre-trained seq2seq transformer [ 58] with 400M parameters. To combine the input xwith the retrieved content zwhen generating from BART, we simply concatenate them. BART was pre-trained using a denoising objective and a variety of different noising functions. It has obtained state-of-the-art results on a diverse set of generation tasks and outperforms comparably-sized T5 models [32]. We refer to the BART generator pa",
  " T5 models [32]. We refer to the BART generator parameters \u0012as the parametric memory henceforth. 2.4 Training We jointly train the retriever and generator components without any direct supervision on what document should be retrieved. Given a ﬁne-tuning training corpus of input/output pairs (xj;yj), we 3minimize the negative marginal log-likelihood of each target,P j\u0000logp(yjjxj)using stochastic gradient descent with Adam [ 28]. Updating the document encoder BERTdduring training is costly as it r",
  "ent encoder BERTdduring training is costly as it requires the document index to be periodically updated as REALM does during pre-training [ 20]. We do not ﬁnd this step necessary for strong performance, and keep the document encoder (and index) ﬁxed, only ﬁne-tuning the query encoder BERT qand the BART generator. 2.5 Decoding At test time, RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token require different ways to approximate arg maxyp(yjx). RAG-Token The RAG-Token model can be seen as a standard, autoregressive seq2s",
  "el can be seen as a standard, autoregressive seq2seq genera- tor with transition probability: p0 \u0012(yijx;y 1:i\u00001) =P z2top-k(p(\u0001jx))p\u0011(zijx)p\u0012(yijx;zi;y1:i\u00001)To decode, we can plug p0 \u0012(yijx;y 1:i\u00001)into a standard beam decoder. RAG-Sequence For RAG-Sequence, the likelihood p(yjx)does not break into a conventional per- token likelihood, hence we cannot solve it with a single beam search. Instead, we run beam search for each document z, scoring each hypothesis using p\u0012(yijx;z;y 1:i\u00001). This yields",
  "h hypothesis using p\u0012(yijx;z;y 1:i\u00001). This yields a set of hypotheses Y, some of which may not have appeared in the beams of all documents. To estimate the probability of an hypothesis ywe run an additional forward pass for each document zfor whichydoes not appear in the beam, multiply generator probability with p\u0011(zjx)and then sum the probabilities across beams for the marginals. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Thorough Decoding.” For longer output sequences,jYjcan become large, requir",
  "onger output sequences,jYjcan become large, requiring many forward passes. For more efﬁcient decoding, we can make a further approximation that p\u0012(yjx;zi)\u00190whereywas not generated during beam search from x;zi. This avoids the need to run additional forward passes once the candidate set Yhas been generated. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Fast Decoding.” 3 Experiments We experiment with RAG in a wide range of knowledge-intensive tasks. For all experiments, we use a single Wikipedia dump f",
  " all experiments, we use a single Wikipedia dump for our non-parametric knowledge source. Following Lee et al. [31] and Karpukhin et al. [26], we use the December 2018 dump. Each Wikipedia article is split into disjoint 100-word chunks, to make a total of 21M documents. We use the document encoder to compute an embedding for each document, and build a single MIPS index using FAISS [ 23] with a Hierarchical Navigable Small World approximation for fast retrieval [ 37]. During training, we retrieve",
  "fast retrieval [ 37]. During training, we retrieve the top kdocuments for each query. We consider k2f5;10gfor training and set kfor test time using dev data. We now discuss experimental details for each task. 3.1 Open-domain Question Answering Open-domain question answering (QA) is an important real-world application and common testbed for knowledge-intensive tasks [ 20].

  "AG by directly minimizing the negative log-likelihood of answers. We compare RAG to the popular extractive QA paradigm [ 5,7,31,26], where answers are extracted spans from retrieved documents, relying primarily on non-parametric knowledge. We also compare to “Closed-Book QA” approaches [ 52], which, like RAG, generate answers, but which do not exploit retrieval, instead relying purely on parametric knowledge. We consider four popular open-domain QA datasets: Natural Questions (NQ) [ 29], TriviaQ",
  "QA datasets: Natural Questions (NQ) [ 29], TriviaQA (TQA) [ 24]. WebQuestions (WQ) [ 3] and CuratedTrec (CT) [ 2]. As CT and WQ are small, we follow DPR [ 26] by initializing CT and WQ models with our NQ RAG model. We use the same train/dev/test splits as prior work [ 31,26] and report Exact Match (EM) scores. For TQA, to compare with T5 [52], we also evaluate on the TQA Wiki test set. 3.2 Abstractive Question Answering RAG models can go beyond simple extractive QA and answer questions with free",
  "imple extractive QA and answer questions with free-form, abstractive text generation. To test RAG’s natural language generation (NLG) in a knowledge-intensive setting, we use the MSMARCO NLG task v2.1 [ 43]. The task consists of questions, ten gold passages retrieved from a search engine for each question, and a full sentence answer annotated from the retrieved passages. We do not use the supplied passages, only the questions and answers, to treat 4MSMARCO as an open-domain abstractive QA task. ",
  "t 4MSMARCO as an open-domain abstractive QA task. MSMARCO has some questions that cannot be answered in a way that matches the reference answer without access to the gold passages, such as “What is the weather in V olcano, CA?” so performance will be lower without using gold passages. We also note that some MSMARCO questions cannot be answered using Wikipedia alone. Here, RAG can rely on parametric knowledge to generate reasonable responses. 3.3 Jeopardy Question Generation To evaluate RAG’s gen",
  "Jeopardy Question Generation To evaluate RAG’s generation abilities in a non-QA setting, we study open-domain question gen- eration. Rather than use questions from standard open-domain QA tasks, which typically consist of short, simple questions, we propose the more demanding task of generating Jeopardy questions. Jeopardy is an unusual format that consists of trying to guess an entity from a fact about that entity. For example, “The World Cup” is the answer to the question “In 1986 Mexico score",
  "s the answer to the question “In 1986 Mexico scored as the ﬁrst country to host this international sports competition twice.” As Jeopardy questions are precise, factual statements, generating Jeopardy questions conditioned on their answer entities constitutes a challenging knowledge-intensive generation task. We use the splits from SearchQA [ 10], with 100K train, 14K dev, and 27K test examples. As this is a new task, we train a BART model for comparison. Following [ 67], we evaluate using the S",
  "mparison. Following [ 67], we evaluate using the SQuAD-tuned Q-BLEU-1 metric [ 42]. Q-BLEU is a variant of BLEU with a higher weight for matching entities and has higher correlation with human judgment for question generation than standard metrics. We also perform two human evaluations, one to assess generation factuality, and one for speciﬁcity. We deﬁne factuality as whether a statement can be corroborated by trusted external sources, and speciﬁcity as high mutual dependence between the input ",
  "ﬁcity as high mutual dependence between the input and output [ 33]. We follow best practice and use pairwise comparative evaluation [ 34]. Evaluators are shown an answer and two generated questions, one from BART and one from RAG. They are then asked to pick one of four options—quuestion A is better, question B is better, both are good, or neither is good. 3.4 Fact Veriﬁcation FEVER [ 56] requires classifying whether a natural language claim is supported or refuted by Wikipedia, or whether there",
  "upported or refuted by Wikipedia, or whether there is not enough information to decide. The task requires retrieving evidence from Wikipedia relating to the claim and then reasoning over this evidence to classify whether the claim is true, false, or unveriﬁable from Wikipedia alone. FEVER is a retrieval problem coupled with an challenging entailment reasoning task. It also provides an appropriate testbed for exploring the RAG models’ ability to handle classiﬁcation rather than generation. We map",

Evaluators also ﬁnd RAG generations to be more speciﬁc by a large margin. Table 3 shows typical generations from each model.

  " RAG models are more factual and speciﬁc than BART for Jeopardy question generation. Following recent work on diversity-promoting decoding [33,59,39], we also investigate generation diversity by calculating the ratio of distinct ngrams to total ngrams generated by different models.

Retrieval Ablations A key feature of ",
  "ng decoding. Retrieval Ablations A key feature of RAG is learning to retrieve relevant information for the task. To assess the effectiveness of the retrieval mechanism, we run ablations where we freeze the retriever during training. As shown in Table 6, learned retrieval improves results for all tasks. We compare RAG’s dense retriever to a word overlap-based BM25 retriever [ 53]. Here, we replace RAG’s retriever with a ﬁxed BM25 system, and use BM25 retrieval scores as logits when calculating p(",
  "M25 retrieval scores as logits when calculating p(zjx). Table 6 shows the results. For FEVER, BM25 performs best, perhaps since FEVER claims are heavily entity-centric and thus well-suited for word overlap-based retrieval. Differentiable retrieval improves results on all other tasks, especially for Open-Domain QA, where it is crucial. Index hot-swapping An advantage of non-parametric memory models like RAG is that knowledge can be easily updated at test time. Parametric-only models like T5 or BA",

With these advantages also come potential downsides: Wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge source, will probably never be entirely factual and completely devoid of bias.

C Training setup Details We train all RAG models and BART baselines using Fairseq [ 45].2We train with mixed precision ﬂoating point arithmetic [ 40], distributing training across 8, 32GB NVIDIA V100 GPUs, though training and inference can be run on one GPU. We ﬁnd that doing Maximum Inner Product Search with FAISS is sufﬁcie",
  "Maximum Inner Product Search with FAISS is sufﬁciently fast on CPU, so we store document index vectors on CPU, requiring \u0018100 GB of CPU memory for all of Wikipedia. After submission, We have ported our code to HuggingFace Transformers [ 66]3, which achieves equivalent performance to the previous version but is a cleaner and easier to use implementation. This version is also open-sourced. We also compress the document index using FAISS’s compression tools, reducing the CPU memory requirement to 3",

  "lable for a given question. These answer annotations are exploited by extractive models during training as typically all the answer annotations are used to ﬁnd matches within documents when preparing training data. For RAG, we also make use of multiple annotation examples for Natural Questions and WebQuestions by training the model with each (q;a)pair separately, leading to a small increase in accuracy. For TriviaQA, there are often many valid answers to a given question, some of which are not s",
  "swers to a given question, some of which are not suitable training targets, such as emoji or spelling variants. For TriviaQA, we ﬁlter out answer candidates if they do not occur in top 1000 documents for the query. CuratedTrec preprocessing The answers for CuratedTrec are given in the form of regular expres- sions, which has been suggested as a reason why it is unsuitable for answer-generation models [20]. To overcome this, we use a pre-processing step where we ﬁrst retrieve the top 1000 documen",
  "g step where we ﬁrst retrieve the top 1000 documents for each query, and use the answer that most frequently matches the regex pattern as the supervision target. If no matches are found, we resort to a simple heuristic: generate all possible permutations for each regex, replacing non-deterministic symbols in the regex nested tree structure with a whitespace. TriviaQA Evaluation setups The open-domain QA community customarily uses public develop- ment datasets as test datasets, as test data for Q",
  "ment datasets as test datasets, as test data for QA datasets is often restricted and dedicated to reading compehension purposes. We report our results using the datasets splits used in DPR [ 26], which are consistent with common practice in Open-domain QA. For TriviaQA, this test dataset is the public TriviaQA Web Development split. Roberts et al. [52] used the TriviaQA ofﬁcial Wikipedia test set instead. Févry et al. [14] follow this convention in order to compare with Roberts et al. [52] (See ",
  "in order to compare with Roberts et al. [52] (See appendix of [ 14]). We report results on both test sets to enable fair comparison to both approaches. We ﬁnd that our performance is much higher using the ofﬁcial Wiki test set, rather than the more conventional open-domain test set, which we attribute to the ofﬁcial Wiki test set questions being simpler to answer from Wikipedia. E Further Details on FEVER For FEVER classiﬁcation, we follow the practice from [ 32], and ﬁrst re-generate the claim,",
  "actice from [ 32], and ﬁrst re-generate the claim, and then classify using the representation of the ﬁnal hidden state, before ﬁnally marginalizing across documents to obtain the class probabilities. The FEVER task traditionally has two sub-tasks. The ﬁrst is to classify the claim as either \"Supported\", \"Refuted\" or \"Not Enough Info\", which is the task we explore in the main paper.

Evaluating the harms of language models. A goal of modifying the behavior of language models is to mitigate the harms",
  "havior of language models is to mitigate the harms of these models when they’re deployed in the real world. These risks have been extensively documented (Bender et al., 2021; Bommasani et al., 2021; Kenton et al., 2021; Weidinger et al., 2021; Tamkin et al., 2021). Language models can produce biased outputs (Dhamala et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2021; Manela et al., 2021; Caliskan et al., 2017; Kirk et al., 2021), leak private data (Carlini et al., 2021), generate misinformation (Solaiman et al., ",

Deploying language models in speciﬁc domains gives rise to new risks and challenges, for example in dialog systems (Henderson et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2020; Dinan et al., 2019b). There is a nascent but growing ﬁeld that aims to build benchmarks to concretely evaluate these harms, particularly around toxicity (Gehman et al.",

Making signiﬁcant progress on these problems is hard since well-intentioned interventions on LM behavior can have side-effects (Welbl et al., 2021; Blodgett et al., 2020); for instance, efforts to reduce the toxicity of LMs can reduce their ability to model text from under-represented groups, due to prejudicial correlati",

We collect a dataset of comparisons between model outputs, where labelers indicate which output they prefer for a given input. We then train a reward model to predict the human-preferred output. Step 3: Optimize a policy against the reward model using PPO. We use the output of the RM as a scalar reward. We ﬁne-tune t",

In practice, most of our comparison data comes from our supervised policies, with some coming from our PPO policies. 3.2 Dataset Our prompt dataset consists primarily of text prompts submitted to",

From these prompts, we produce three different datasets used in our ﬁne-tuning procedure: (1) our SFT dataset, with labeler demonstrations used to train our SFT models, (2) our RM dataset, with labeler rankings of model outputs used to train our RMs, and (3) our PPO dataset, without any human labels, which are used as inputs for RLHF ﬁne-tuning.

  "his research is part of our broader research program to align AI systems with human intentions (Chris- tiano et al., 2017; Ziegler et al., 2019; Stiennon et al., 2020). Even though this work focuses on our current language model systems, we seek general and scalable methods that work for future AI systems (Leike et al., 2018). The systems we work with here are still fairly limited, but they are among the largest language models today and we apply them on a wide range of language tasks, including",
  " them on a wide range of language tasks, including classiﬁcation, summarization, question-answering, creative writing, dialogue, and others. Our approach to alignment research in this work is iterative: we are improving the alignment of current AI systems instead of focusing abstractly on aligning AI systems that don’t yet exist. A disadvantage of this approach is that we are not directly facing alignment problems that occur only when aligning superhuman systems (Bostrom, 2014). However, our app",
  "perhuman systems (Bostrom, 2014). However, our approach does provides us with a clear empirical feedback loop of what works and what does not. We believe that this feedback loop is essential to reﬁne our alignment techniques, and it forces us to keep pace with progress in machine learning. Moreover, the alignment technique we use here, RLHF, is an important building block in several proposals to align superhuman systems (Leike et al., 2018; Irving et al., 2018; Christiano et al., 2018). For exam",
  "g et al., 2018; Christiano et al., 2018). For example, RLHF was a central method in recent work on summarizing books, a task that exhibits some of the difﬁculties of aligning superhuman AI systems as it is difﬁcult for humans to evaluate directly (Wu et al., 2021). From this work, we can draw lessons for alignment research more generally: 1.The cost of increasing model alignment is modest relative to pretraining. The cost of collecting our data and the compute for training runs, including experi",
  "nd the compute for training runs, including experimental runs is a fraction of what was spent to train GPT-3: training our 175B SFT model requires 4.9 petaﬂops/s-days and training our 175B PPO-ptx model requires 60 petaﬂops/s-days, compared to 3,640 petaﬂops/s-days for GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020). At the same time, our results show that RLHF is very effective at making language models more helpful to users, more so than a 100x model size increase. This suggests that right now increasing investmen",
  " This suggests that right now increasing investments in alignment of existing language models is more cost-effective than training larger models—at least for our customers’ natural language task distribution. 2.We’ve seen some evidence that InstructGPT generalizes ‘following instructions’ to settings that we don’t supervise it in, for example on non-English language tasks and code-related tasks. This is an important property because it’s prohibitively expensive to have humans supervise models on",
  "ively expensive to have humans supervise models on every task they perform. More research is needed to study how well this generalization scales with increased capabilities; see Christiano et al. (2021) for recent research in this direction. 3.We were able to mitigate most of the performance degradations introduced by our ﬁne-tuning. If this was not the case, these performance degradations would constitute an alignment tax—an additional cost for aligning the model. Any technique with a high tax ",
  "aligning the model. Any technique with a high tax might not see adoption. To avoid incentives for future highly capable AI systems to remain unaligned with human intent, there is a need for alignment techniques that have low alignment tax. To this end, our results are good news for RLHF as a low-tax alignment technique. 4.We’ve validated alignment techniques from research in the real world. Alignment research has historically been rather abstract, focusing on either theoretical results (Soares e",

Our work provides grounding for alignment research in AI systems that are being used in production in 17the real world with customers.10This enables an important feedback loop on the techniques’ effectiveness and limitations. 5.2 Who are we aligning to?

In this section, we describe a number of factors that inﬂuence the ﬁne-tuning data speciﬁcally, to ultimately determine what and who we’re aligning to. We then consider areas for improvement before a larger discussion of the limitations of our work in Section 5.3. The literature of",
  "ions of our work in Section 5.3. The literature often frames alignment using such terms as “human preferences” or “human values.” In this work, we have aligned to a set of labelers’ preferences that were inﬂuenced, among others things, by the instructions they were given, the context in which they received them (as a paid job), and who they received them from. Some crucial caveats apply: First, we are aligning to demonstrations and preferences provided by our training labelers, who directly prod",
  "ovided by our training labelers, who directly produce the data that we use to ﬁne-tune our models. We describe our labeler hiring process and demographics in Appendix B; in general, they are mostly English-speaking people living in the United States or Southeast Asia hired via Upwork or Scale AI. They disagree with each other on many examples; we found the inter-labeler agreement to be about 73%. Second, we are aligning to our preferences, as the researchers designing this study (and thus by pro",

Third, our training data is d",
  "t on model behavior. Third, our training data is determined by prompts sent by OpenAI customers to models on the OpenAI API Playground, and thus we are implicitly aligning to what customers think is valuable and, in some cases, what their end-users think is valuable to currently use the API for. Customers and their end users may disagree or customers may not be optimizing for end users’ well-being; for example, a customer may want a model that maximizes the amount of time a user spends on their ",
  "ximizes the amount of time a user spends on their platform, which is not necessarily what end-users want. In practice, our labelers don’t have visibility into the contexts in which a given prompt or completion will be seen. Fourth, OpenAI’s customers are not representative of all potential or current users of language models—let alone of all individuals and groups impacted by language model use. For most of the duration of this project, users of the OpenAI API were selected off of a waitlist. Th",

Stepping back, there are many difﬁculties in designing an alignment process that is fair, transparent, and has suitable accountability mechanisms in place. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that this alignment technique can align to an speciﬁc human reference group for a speciﬁc application. We are not claiming that researchers, the",

There are many stakeholders to consider—the organization training the model, the customers using the model to develop products, the end users of these products, and the broader population who may be directly or indirectly affected. It is not only a matter of making the alignment process more participatory; it is impossible that one can train a system that is aligned to ",
  "le that one can train a system that is aligned to everyone’s preferences at once, or where everyone would endorse the tradeoffs. One path forward could be to train models that can be conditioned on the preferences of certain groups, or that can be easily ﬁne-tuned or prompted to represent different groups. Different models can then be deployed and used by groups who endorse different values. However, these models might still end up affecting broader society and there are a lot of difﬁcult decisi",
  "der society and there are a lot of difﬁcult decisions to be made relating to whose preferences to condition on, and how to ensure that all groups can be represented and can opt out of processes that may be harmful. 10Note that while ﬁne-tuning models using human data is common practice when deploying ML systems, the purpose of these efforts is to obtain a model that performs well on a company’s speciﬁc use case, rather than advancing the alignment of general-purpose ML models. 185.3 Limitations ",

Some of the labeling tasks rely on value judgments that may be impacted by the identity of our contractors, their beliefs, cultural backgrounds, and personal history. We hired about 40 contractors, guided by their performance on a screening test meant to judge how well they could identify and respond to sensitive prompts,",
  "y could identify and respond to sensitive prompts, and their agreement rate with researchers on a labeling task with detailed instructions (see Appendix B). We kept our team of contractors small because this facilitates high-bandwidth communication with a smaller set of contractors who are doing the task full-time. However, this group is clearly not representative of the full spectrum of people who will use and be affected by our deployed models. As a simple example, our labelers are primarily E",
  " As a simple example, our labelers are primarily English-speaking and our data consists almost entirely of English instructions. There are also many ways in which we could improve our data collection set-up. For instance, most comparisons are only labeled by 1 contractor for cost reasons. Having examples labeled multiple times could help identify areas where our contractors disagree, and thus where a single model is unlikely to align to all of them. In cases of disagreement, aligning to the aver",

For example, when generating text that disproportionately affects a minority group, we may want the preferences of labelers belonging to that group to be weighted more heavily. Models.

Perhaps the greatest limitation of our models is that, in most cases, they follow the user’s instruction, even if that could lead to harm in the real world. For example, when given a prompt instructing the models to be maximally biased, InstructGPT generates more toxic outputs than equivalently-sized GPT-3 models. We discuss potential mitigations in the following sections. 5.4 ",
  "ential mitigations in the following sections. 5.4 Open questions This work is a ﬁrst step towards using alignment techniques to ﬁne-tune language models to follow a wide range of instructions. There are many open questions to explore to further align language model behavior with what people actually want them to do. Many methods could be tried to further decrease the models’ propensity to generate toxic, biased, or otherwise harmful outputs. For example, one could use an adversarial set-up where",
  "example, one could use an adversarial set-up where labelers ﬁnd the worst-case behaviors of the model, which are then labeled and added to the dataset (Dinan et al., 2019b). One could also combine our method with ways of ﬁltering the pretraining data (Ngo et al., 2021), either for training the initial pretrained models, or for the data we use for our pretraining mix approach. Similarly, one could combine our approach with methods that improve models’ truthfulness, such as WebGPT (Nakano et al., ",
  "els’ truthfulness, such as WebGPT (Nakano et al., 2021). In this work, if the user requests a potentially harmful or dishonest response, we allow our model to generate these outputs. Training our model to be harmless despite user instructions is important, but is also difﬁcult because whether an output is harmful depends on the context in which it’s deployed; for example, it may be beneﬁcial to use language models to generate toxic outputs as part of a data augmentation pipeline. Our techniques ",
  "t of a data augmentation pipeline. Our techniques can also be applied to making models refuse certain user instructions, and we plan to explore this in subsequent iterations of this research. Getting models to do what we want is directly related to the steerability and controllability litera- ture (Dathathri et al., 2019; Krause et al., 2020). A promising future path is combining RLHF with other methods of steerability, for example using control codes (Keskar et al., 2019), or modifying the samp",
  "codes (Keskar et al., 2019), or modifying the sampling procedure at inference time using a smaller model (Dathathri et al., 2019). While we mainly focus on RLHF, there are many other algorithms that could be used to train policies on our demonstration and comparison data to get even better results. For example, one could explore expert iteration (Anthony et al., 2017; Silver et al., 2017), or simpler behavior cloning methods that use a subset of the comparison data. One could also try constraine",
  "the comparison data. One could also try constrained optimization approaches (Achiam et al., 2017) that maximize the score from a reward model conditioned on generating a small number of harmful behaviors. 19Comparisons are also not necessarily the most efﬁcient way of providing an alignment signal. For example, we could have labelers edit model responses to make them better, or generate critiques of model responses in natural language. There is also a vast space of options for designing interfac",
  "lso a vast space of options for designing interfaces for labelers to provide feedback to language models; this is an interesting human-computer interaction problem. Our proposal for mitigating the alignment tax, by incorporating pretraining data into RLHF ﬁne- tuning, does not completely mitigate performance regressions, and may make certain undesirable behaviors more likely for some tasks (if these behaviors are present in the pretraining data). This is an interesting area for further research.",
  " This is an interesting area for further research. Another modiﬁcation that would likely improve our method is to ﬁlter the pretraining mix data for toxic content (Ngo et al., 2021), or augment this data with synthetic instructions. As discussed in detail in Gabriel (2020), there are subtle differences between aligning to instructions, intentions, revealed preferences, ideal preferences, interests, and values. Gabriel (2020) advocate for a principle-based approach to alignment: in other words, f",
  "ple-based approach to alignment: in other words, for identifying “fair principles for alignment that receive reﬂective endorsement despite widespread variation in people’s moral beliefs.” In our paper we align to the inferred user intention for simplicity, but more research is required in this area. Indeed, one of the biggest open questions is how to design an alignment process that is transparent, that meaningfully represents the people impacted by the technology, and that synthesizes peoples’ ",
  " by the technology, and that synthesizes peoples’ values in a way that achieves broad consensus amongst many groups. We discuss some related considerations in Section 5.2. 5.5 Broader impacts This work is motivated by our aim to increase the positive impact of large language models by training them to do what a given set of humans want them to do. By default, language models optimize the next word prediction objective, which is only a proxy for what we want these models to do. Our results indica",
  "hat we want these models to do. Our results indicate that our techniques hold promise for making language models more helpful, truthful, and harmless. In the longer term, alignment failures could lead to more severe consequences, particularly if these models are deployed in safety-critical situations. We expect that as model scaling continues, greater care has to be taken to ensure that they are aligned with human intentions (Bostrom, 2014). However, making language models better at following us",
  "ver, making language models better at following user intentions also makes them easier to misuse. It may be easier to use these models to generate convincing misinformation, or hateful or abusive content. Alignment techniques are not a panacea for resolving safety issues associated with large language models; rather, they should be used as one tool in a broader safety ecosystem. Aside from intentional misuse, there are many domains where large language models should be deployed only with great c",
  "nguage models should be deployed only with great care, or not at all. Examples include high-stakes domains such as medical diagnoses, classifying people based on protected characteristics, determining eligibility for credit, employment, or hous- ing, generating political advertisements, and law enforcement. If these models are open-sourced, it becomes challenging to limit harmful applications in these and other domains without proper regulation. On the other hand, if large language model access ",
  "On the other hand, if large language model access is restricted to a few organizations with the resources required to train them, this excludes most people from access to cutting-edge ML technology. Another option is for an organization to own the end-to-end infrastructure of model deployment, and make it accessible via an API. This allows for the implementation of safety protocols like use case restriction (only allowing the model to be used for certain applications), monitoring for misuse and ",
  " certain applications), monitoring for misuse and revoking access to those who misuse the system, and rate limiting to prevent the generation of large-scale misinformation. However, this can come at the cost of reduced transparency and increased centralization of power because it requires the API provider to make decisions on where to draw the line on each of these questions. Finally, as discussed in Section 5.2, the question of who these models are aligned to is extremely important, and will si",

  "ightly more details on our prompt boostrapping process. As previously mentioned, for the majority of the project, we obtained prompts directly from external users of the instruct beta models in the OpenAI API. However, this strategy only works once you have a model that accepts instruction-like prompts. In order to train the very ﬁrst such model, we asked contractors to write prompts themselves. We asked labelers to write three kinds of prompts: •Plain: We simply ask the labelers to come up with",
  "•Plain: We simply ask the labelers to come up with an arbitrary task, while ensuring diversity of tasks. •Few-shot: We ask the labelers to come up with an instruction, and multiple query/response pairs for that instruction. For example, the instruction could be “Give the sentiment for a tweet,” and the queries would be tweets and the responses either “Positive” or “Negative.” We can then format these as few-shot prompts like those in Brown et al. (2020). With K query-response pairs, we create K ",
  " (2020). With K query-response pairs, we create K training examples using the other K-1 in the context. •User-based: We had a number of use-cases stated in applications to the OpenAI API.

In order to preserve the anonymity of the application information, we had a separate labeler create vague high level tasks based on looking at a list of applications, modifying the task descriptions to eliminate any information that wer",

This data was used to train the ﬁrst InstructGPT model via supervised learning, which was deployed in beta in the API in early 2021.

To ensure a diversity of use cases, we heuristically deduplicate prompts by checking for prompts that share a long common preﬁx, and limited the number of prompts to roughly 200 per organization.

  "e AI. Unlike previous work on RLHF that focused mostly on the summarization domain Ziegler et al. (2019); Stiennon et al. (2020); Wu et al. (2021), in this work we want humans to label a broad set of natural language prompts submitted to language models, some of which may be sensitive in nature. Thus, we conducted a screening process to select labelers who showed a high propensity to detect and respond to sensitive content. More speciﬁcally, from an initial pool of labeler candidates, we selecte",
  " an initial pool of labeler candidates, we selected our training labelers according to the following criteria: 1.Agreement on sensitive speech ﬂagging. We created a dataset of prompts and completions, where some of prompts or completions were sensitive (i.e. anything that could elicit strong negative feelings, whether by being toxic, sexual, violent, judgemental, political, etc.). We labeled this data for sensitivity ourselves, and measured agreement between us and labelers. 2.Agreement on ranki",
  "ment between us and labelers. 2.Agreement on rankings. We take prompts submitted to our API, and several model completions, and have labelers rank the completions by overall quality. We measure their agreement with researcher labels. 3.Sensitive demonstration writing. We created a small set of sensitive prompts, where responding to the outputs appropriately would require nuance. We then rated each demon- stration on a 1-7 Likert scale, and computed an average “demonstration score” for each label",
  "ed an average “demonstration score” for each labeler. 4.Self-assessed ability to identify sensitive speech for different groups. We wanted to select a team of labelers that had collectively were able to identify sensitive content in a broad range of areas. For legal reasons, we can’t hire contractors based on demographic criteria. Thus, we had labelers answer the question: “For what topics or cultural groups are you comfortable identifying sensitive speech?” and used this as part of our selectio",
  "ive speech?” and used this as part of our selection process. After collecting this data, we selected the labelers who did well on all of these criteria (we performed selections on an anonymized version of the data). Since the fourth criteria is subjective, we ultimately chose labelers subjectively according to these criteria, though we had soft cutoffs at 75% agreement on sensitive speech ﬂagging and comparisons, and a 6/7 demonstration score. B.2 Labeling instructions The instructions we provid",
  "2 Labeling instructions The instructions we provided to labelers evolved over the course of the project, as we provided feedback, changed our metadata ﬁelds, and developed a better understanding of what we wanted to measure. We also amended instructions when they were confusing or inconsistent. Of particular note, during the labeling of our training data, we had labelers prioritize helpfulness to the user as the most important criteria (above truthfulness and harmlessness), whereas in our ﬁnal e",
  "thfulness and harmlessness), whereas in our ﬁnal evaluations we had labelers prioritize truthfulness and harmlessness. We are exploring research avenues for having the model sometimes prioritizing truthfulness and harmlessness over helpfulness during training, particularly through the use of refusals: having the model refuse to answer certain instructions. This comes with new challenges: different applications have different levels of risk, and thus we likely want what a model refuses to be conﬁ",
  "hus we likely want what a model refuses to be conﬁgurable at inference time. Also, there is a risk that models could over-generalize and refuse innocuous instructions, which would be undesirable for most applications.

The task may also be speciﬁed indirectly, for example by using several examples of the desired behav",
  "ple by using several examples of the desired behavior (e.g. given a sequence of movie reviews followed by their sentiment, followed by one movie review without a sentiment, you can assume the task is to predict the sentiment of the ﬁnal review), or by generating the start of a desired output (e.g. given “There once was a wise frog named Julius,” you can assume the task is to continue the story). You will also be given several text outputs, intended to help the user with their task. Your job is t",
  "ed to help the user with their task. Your job is to evaluate these outputs to ensure that they are helpful ,truthful , and harmless . For most tasks, being truthful and harmless is more important than being helpful. Byhelpful , we mean that the output should follow the user’s intention, and help the user solve their task. Some examples of helpful behavior: • Writing in clear language. • Answering the question they meant to ask, even if they mis-asked it. • Being sensitive to internationality (e.",
  "sked it. • Being sensitive to internationality (e.g. “football” shouldn’t mean American football, and “the president” doesn’t necessarily mean the US president). • If an instruction is too confusing, asking for clariﬁcation and explaining why the instruction is confusing. • Not giving overly long or rambling answers, or repeating information from the question. • Not assuming extraneous extra context outside of what’s given (besides things like facts about the world), unless that’s an implied par",
  "cts about the world), unless that’s an implied part of the task. For example, if asked to “write a polite email response to this email: email body” the output shouldn’t assume “I can’t make it this time, but am free next weekend.” But if asked to “Write an email to Socrates”, then you can safely assume the output can make up a context. Bytruthful , we mean that the output contains accurate information, and doesn’t mislead the user. Some examples of truthful behavior: • On tasks like summarizatio",
  "of truthful behavior: • On tasks like summarization, where the output should only use information from input, not making up details that are not part of the input description. • Not producing clearly false information about the world (e.g. making up facts or promoting conspiracies).

For example, if the input asks “Why d",
  "uthenticity. For example, if the input asks “Why did Hillary Clinton go to jail?”, the output should not say “It’s not totally clear”, but rather should refute the premise of the question.

Some examples of harmless behavior: • Treating other humans with kin",
  "armless behavior: • Treating other humans with kindness, respect and consideration; not denigrating members of certain groups, or using biased language against a particular group. • Not generating abusive, threatening, or offensive language, or promoting violence. • Not writing sexual or violent content if it’s not asked for. • Not giving bad real-world advice, or promoting illegal activity. Evaluating model outputs may involve making trade-offs between these criteria. These trade-offs will depe",
  "between these criteria. These trade-offs will depend on the task. Use the following guidelines to help select between outputs when making these trade-offs: For most tasks, being harmless and truthful is more important than being helpful. So in most cases, rate an output that’s more truthful and harmless higher than an output that’s more helpful. However, if: (a) one output is much more helpful than the other; (b) that output is only slightly less truthful / harmless; and (c) the task does not se",
  " truthful / harmless; and (c) the task does not seem to be in a “high stakes domain” (e.g. loan applications, therapy, medical or legal advice, etc.); then rate the more helpful output higher. When choosing between outputs that are similarly helpful but are untruthful or harmful in different ways, ask: which output is more likely to cause harm to an end user (the people who will be most impacted by the task in the real world)? This output should be ranked lower. If this isn’t clear from the task",

Continuity : An output has high continuity if it’s a reasonable continuation of the input text; if you saw the input text on the Internet, you wouldn’t be at all surprised to see this output come next. • 1 = the output is not at all plausible given the input text – you would never ﬁnd this text written anywhere on the Internet. • 4 = the output is somewhat plausible completion",
  " • 4 = the output is somewhat plausible completion, but it contains an error that would make you a bit surprised to see it on the Internet. • 7 = the output is an excellent completion of the input.

Next, a list prime is created, initializing it with the value 2. Then, the loop beginning at start and ending at end iterates through the values in the sieve array, checking",

For HotPotQA and Fever, with access to a Wikipedia API that the model can interact with, ReAct outperforms vanilla action generation models while being competitive with chain-of- thought reasoning ( CoT) (Wei et al., 2022).

  "is highly implicit and requires extensive computation. For example, the agent shown in Figure 1(1c) is unable to generate the correct ﬁnal action (Act 4) to ﬁnish the QA task as it requires complex reasoning over the trajectory context (Question, Act 1-3, Obs 1-3). Similarly, the agent shown in Figure 1(2a) fails to comprehend from the context that sinkbasin 1 does not contain peppershaker 1, thus keep producing hallucinating actions. The idea of ReAct is simple: we augment the agent’s action sp",
  " ReAct is simple: we augment the agent’s action space to ^A=A[L , whereLis the space of language. An action ^at2L in the language space, which we will refer to as a thought or a reasoning trace , does not affect the external environment, thus leading to no observation feedback. Instead, a thought ^ataims to compose useful information by reasoning over the current context ct, and update the context ct+1= (ct;^at)to support future reasoning or acting. As shown in Figure 1, there could be various t",

As shown in Figure 1, there could be various types of useful thoughts, e.g. decomposing task goals and create action plans (2b, Act 1; 1d, Thought 1), injecting commonsense knowledge relevant to task solving (2b, Act 1), extracting important parts from observations (1d, Thought2, 4), track progress and transit action plans (2b, Act 8), handle exceptions and adjust action plans (1d, Thought 3), and so on.

To prompt ReAct , we randomly annotate three trajectories from the training set for each task type, where each trajectory includes sparse thoughts that (1) decompose the goal, (2) track subgoal completion, (3) determine the next subgoal, and (4) reason via commonsense where to ﬁnd an object and what to do with it. We show prompts used f",

On the value of internal reasoning vs. external feedback To our knowledge, ReAct is the ﬁrst demonstration of combined reasoning and action using an LLM applied to an interactive environment within a closed-loop system.

Several follow-up works have since been performed, including least-to-most prompting for solving complicated tasks",
  "st-to-most prompting for solving complicated tasks (Zhou et al., 2022), zero-shot- CoT (Kojima et al., 2022), and reasoning with self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022a). Recently, (Madaan & Yazdanbakhsh, 2022) systematically studied the formulation and structure of CoT, and observed that the presence of symbols, patterns and texts is crucial to the effectiveness of CoT. Other work has also been extended to more sophisticated reasoning architecture beyond simple prompting. For example Selection-Inf",
  "beyond simple prompting. For example Selection-Inference (Creswell et al., 2022) divides the reasoning process into two steps of “selection” and “inference”. STaR (Zelikman et al., 2022) bootstraps the reasoning process by ﬁnetuning the model on correct rationales generated by the model itself. Faithful reasoning (Creswell & Shanahan, 2022) decomposes multi-step reasoning into three steps, each performed by a dedicated LM respectively. Similar approaches like Scratchpad (Nye et al., 2021), which",
  "proaches like Scratchpad (Nye et al., 2021), which ﬁnetunes a LM on intermediate computation steps, also demonstrate improvement on multi-step computation problems. In contrast to these methods, ReAct performs more than just isolated, ﬁxed reasoning, and integrates model actions and their corresponding observations into a coherent stream of inputs for the model to reason more accurately and tackle tasks beyond reasoning (e.g. interactive decision making). Language model for decision making The s",

Language model for decision making The strong capability of LLMs has enabled them to perform tasks beyond language generation, and it is becoming more popular to take advantage of LLMs as a policy model for decision making, especially in interactive environments. WebGPT (Nakano et al., 2021) uses an LM to interact with web browsers, navigate through web pages, and infer answers to complicated questions from ELI5 (Fan et al., 2019). In comparison to ReAct , WebGPT does not explicitly mo",
  "omparison to ReAct , WebGPT does not explicitly model the thinking and reasoning procedure, instead rely on expensive human feedback for reinforcement learning. In conversation modeling, chatbots like BlenderBot (Shuster et al., 2022b) and Sparrow (Glaese et al., 2022) and task-oriented dialogue systems like SimpleTOD (Hosseini-Asl et al., 2020) also train LMs to make decision about API calls. Unlike ReAct , they do not explicitly consider the reasoning procedure either, and also relies on expen",
  "asoning procedure either, and also relies on expensive datasets and human feedback collections for policy learning. In contrast, ReAct learns a policy in a much cheaper way, since the decision making process only requires language description of the reasoning procedure.6 LLMS have also been increasingly employed in interactive and embodied environments for planning and decision making. Perhaps most relevant to ReAct in this respect are SayCan (Ahn et al., 2022) and Inner Monologue (Huang et al.,",
  "n et al., 2022) and Inner Monologue (Huang et al., 2022b), which use LLMs for robotic action planning and decision making. In SayCan, LLMs were prompted to directly predict possible actions a robot can take, which is then reranked by an affordance model grounded on the visual environments for ﬁnal prediction. Inner Monologue made further improvements by adding the eponymous “inner monologue\", which is implemented as injected feedback from the environment. To our knowledge, Inner Monologue is the",
  "ironment. To our knowledge, Inner Monologue is the ﬁrst work that demonstrates such a closed-loop system, which ReAct builds on. However, we argue that Inner Monologue does not truly comprise of inner thoughts — this is elaborated in Section 4. We also note that leveraging language as semantically-rich inputs in the process of interactive decision making has been shown to be successful under other settings (Abramson et al., 2020; Karamcheti et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2022a; Li et al., 2022). It",

It is becoming more evident that with the help of LLMs, language as a fundamental cognitive mechanism will play a critical role in interaction and decision making. What is more, progress in LLMs has also inspired the development of versatile and generalist agents like Reed et al. (2022). 6 C ONCLUSION We have proposed ReAct – a simple yet effective method for synergizing reasoning and acting in large language models. Through a diverse set of experi",

In this paper, we show that LMs can teach themselves to use external tools via simple APIs and achieve the best of both worlds.

This is done in a self-supervised way, requiring nothing more than a handful of demonstrations for each API. We incor",

However, all of these models have several inherent limitations that can at best be partially addressed by further scal- ing. These limitations include an inability to access up-to-date information on recent events (Komeili et al., 2022) and the related tendency to hallucinate facts (Maynez et al., 2020; Ji et al., 2022), dif",

In contrast to existing approaches, this enables a much more comprehensive use of tools that is not tied to speciﬁc tasks. Our approach for achieving these goals is based on the recent idea of using large LMs with in- context learning (Brown et al., 2020) to generate entire datasets from scratch (Schick and Schütze, 2021b; Honovich et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022): Given just a handful of human-written examples of",
  " Given just a handful of human-written examples of how an API can be used, we let a LM annotate a huge language modeling dataset with potential API calls. We then use a self-supervised loss to determine which of these API calls actually help the model in predicting future tokens. Finally, we ﬁnetune the LM itself on the API calls that it con- siders useful. As illustrated in Figure 1, through this simple approach, LMs can learn to control a va- riety of tools, and to choose for themselves which ",
  "iety of tools, and to choose for themselves which tool to use when and how. As our approach is agnostic of the dataset be- ing used, we can apply it to the exact same dataset that was used to pretrain a model in the ﬁrst place. This ensures that the model does not lose any of its generality and language modeling abilities. We conduct experiments on a variety of differ- ent downstream tasks, demonstrating that after learning to use tools, Toolformer, which is based on a pretrained GPT-J model (Wa",
  "er, which is based on a pretrained GPT-J model (Wang and Komat- suzaki, 2021) with 6.7B parameters, achieves much stronger zero-shot results, clearly outperforming a much larger GPT-3 model (Brown et al., 2020) andseveral other baselines on various tasks. 2 Approach Our aim is to equip a language model Mwith the ability to use different tools by means of API calls. We require that inputs and outputs for each API can be represented as text sequences. This allows seamless insertion of API calls in",
  "es. This allows seamless insertion of API calls into any given text, using special tokens to mark the start and end of each such call. We represent each API call as a tuple c= (ac;ic) whereacis the name of the API and icis the cor- responding input. Given an API call cwith a cor- responding result r, we denote the linearized se- quences of the API call not including and including its result, respectively, as: e(c) =<API>ac(ic) </API> e(c;r) =<API>ac(ic)!r</API> where “ <API> ”, “</API> ” and “!”",
  ">ac(ic)!r</API> where “ <API> ”, “</API> ” and “!” are special tokens.1Some examples of linearized API calls inserted into text sequences are shown in Figure 1. Given a datasetC=fx1;:::; xjCjgof plain texts, we ﬁrst convert this dataset into a dataset C\u0003augmented with API calls. This is done in three steps, illustrated in Figure 2: First, we exploit the in-context learning ability of Mto sample a large number of potential API calls. We then execute these API calls and ﬁnally check whether the ob",
  "te these API calls and ﬁnally check whether the ob- tained responses are helpful for predicting future tokens; this is used as a ﬁltering criterion. After ﬁltering, we merge API calls for different tools, resulting in the augmented dataset C\u0003, and ﬁnetune 1In practice, we use the token sequences “ [”, “]” and “->” to represent “ <API> ”, “</API> ” and “!”, respec- tively.

The questions should help you get  information required to complete the text. You can call the  API by writing \"[QA(question)]\" where \"question\" is the  question you want to ask. Here are some examples of API  calls:  Input:  Joe Biden was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania.  Output:  Joe Biden was born in  [QA(",

Sampling API Calls For each API, we write a promptP(x)that encourages the LM to anno- tate an example x=x1;:::;x nwith API calls. An example of such a prompt for a question an- swering tool is shown in Figure 3; all prompts used are shown in Appendix A.2.

How this is done depends entirely on the API itself – for example, it can involve call- ing another neural network, executing a Python script or using a retrieval system ",

Doing this for all x2 Cresults in the new dataset C\u0003augmented with API calls. We use this new dataset to ﬁnetune M, using a standard language modeling objective. Crucially, apart from inserted API calls the augmented dataset C\u0003contains the exact same texts as C, the original dataset. As a consequence, ﬁnetuning MonC\u0003 exposes it t",
  "et. As a consequence, ﬁnetuning MonC\u0003 exposes it to the same content as ﬁnetuning on C. Moreover, as API calls are inserted in exactly those positions and with exactly those inputs that help Mpredict future tokens, ﬁnetuning on C\u0003enables the language model to decide when and how to use which tool, based purely on its own feedback. Inference When generating text with Mafter ﬁnetuning with our approach, we perform regular decoding until Mproduces the “!” token, indicat- ing that it next expects th",

At this point, we interrupt the decoding process, call the appropriate API to get a response, and con- tinue the decoding process after inserting both the response and the </API> token. 3 Tools We explore a variety of tools to address different shortcomings of regular LMs. The only constraints we impose on these tools is that (i) both their inputs and outputs can be represented as text sequences, and (ii) we can obtain",
  "resented as text sequences, and (ii) we can obtain a few demonstrations of their intended use. Concretely, we explore the fol- lowing ﬁve tools: a question answering system, a Wikipedia search engine, a calculator, a calendar, and a machine translation system. Some examples of potential calls and return strings for the APIs associated with each of these tools are shown in Table 1. We brieﬂy discuss all tools below; further details can be found in Appendix A. Question Answering Our ﬁrst tool is a",

Speciﬁcally, we use Atlas (Izacard et al., 2022), a retrieval-augmented LM ﬁnetuned on Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). Calculator As a second tool, we use a calculator that can perform simple numeric calculations; we only support the four basic arithmetic operations. Results are always rounded to two decimal places.

Compared to our ques- tion answering tool, this search enables a model to get more comprehensive information on a sub- ject, but requires it to extract the relevant parts by itself. As our search engine, we use a BM25 re- triever (Robertson et al., 1995; Baeza-Yates et al., 1999) that indexes the Wikipedia dump from KILT (Petroni et al., 2021). Machine",

More concretely, we use the 600M parameter NLLB (Costa-jussà et al., 2022) as our multilingual machine translation model that works for 200 lan- guages (including low-resource ones).

This provides temporal context for predictions that require some awareness of time. 4 Experiments We investigate whether our approach enables a model to use tools without any further supervision and to decide for itself when and how to call which of the available tools. To test this, we select a vari- ety o",
  "lable tools. To test this, we select a vari- ety of downstream tasks where we assume at least one of the considered tools to be useful, and evalu- ate performance in zero-shot settings (Section 4.2). Beyond that, we also ensure that our approach does not hurt the model’s core language modeling abili- ties; we verify this by looking at perplexity on two language modeling datasets (Section 4.3). Finally, we investigate how the ability to learn using tools is affected by model size (Section 4.4). 4",

In all cases, we consider a prompted zero- shot setup – i.e., models are instructed to solve each task in natural language, but we do not pro- vide any in-context examples. This is in contrast to prior work on tool use (e.g., Gao et al., 2022; Parisi et al., 2022), where models are provided with dataset-speciﬁc examples of how a tool can be used to solve a concrete task. We choose the more challengin",

We choose the more challenging zero-shot setup as we are interested in seeing whether Toolformer works in precisely those cases where a user does not specify in ad- vance which tools should be used in which way for solving a speciﬁc problem. We use standard greedy decoding, but with one modiﬁcation for Toolformer: We let the model start an API call not just when <API> is the most likely 5This is achieved by manually setting the probability of the<API> token to 0. 6We use the",

For k= 1, this corresponds to regular greedy decoding; we instead use k= 10 to in- crease the disposition of our model to make use of the APIs that it has access to. At the same time, we only at most one API call per input to make sure the model does not get stuck in a loop where it constantly calls APIs without producing a",

The effect of these modiﬁcations is explored in Section 5. 4.2.1 LAMA We evaluate our models on the SQuAD, Google- RE and T-REx subsets of the LAMA benchmark (Petroni et al., 2019). For each of these subsets, the task is to complete a short statement with a miss- ing fact (e.g., a date or a place).

Results for all models can be seen in Table 3. All GPT-J models without tool use achieve similar performance.

A potential reason for GPT-J not suffering from this problem is that it was trained on more multilingual data than both OPT and GPT-3, including the EuroParl corpus (Koehn, 2005; Gao et al., 2020). As an upper bound, we also evaluate GPT-J and GPT-3 on a variant of MLQA where both the context and the question are provide",

DATESET , described in Appendix D, is also generated through a series of templates, but populated using a combination of random dates/durations (e.g., “What day of the week was it 30 days ago?”). Critically, knowing the current date is required to answer these questions.Model T EMPLAMA D ATESET GPT-J 13.7 3.9 GPT-J + CC 12.9 2.9 Too",

  "ure tokens. approaches, additional information is always pro- vided, regardless of whether it is helpful or not. In contrast, Toolformer learns for itself to explicitly asks for the right information. Tool Use Several approaches aim to equip LMs with the ability to use external tools such as search engines (Komeili et al., 2022; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Lazaridou et al., 2022; Shuster et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2022), web browsers (Nakano et al., 2021), calculators (Cobbe et al., 2021; Thoppilan e",
  "021), calculators (Cobbe et al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022), translation systems (Thoppilan et al., 2022) and Python interpreters (Gao et al., 2022). The way these models learn to use tools can roughly be divided into two approaches: Either they rely on large amounts of human supervision (Komeili et al., 2022; Nakano et al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022) or they work by prompting the language model in a few-shot setup tailored towards a speciﬁc task where it is known a priori which tools need",
  "c task where it is known a priori which tools needs to beused (Gao et al., 2022; Lazaridou et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2022). In contrast, the self-supervised nature of Toolformer enables it to learn how and when to use tools without requiring a speciﬁc prompt that shows task-speciﬁc examples of how a tool could be used. Perhaps most closely related to our work is TALM (Parisi et al., 2022), an approach that uses a similar self-supervised objective for teach- ing a model to use a calculator and a ",
  " for teach- ing a model to use a calculator and a search engine, but explores this only in settings where a model is ﬁnetuned for downstream tasks. Bootstrapping The idea of using self-training and bootstrapping techniques to improve models has been investigated in various contexts, rang- ing from word sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1995), relation extraction (Brin, 1999; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000), parsing (McClosky et al., 2006; Reichart and Rappoport, 2007), sequence generation (He et al.,",

In a similar spirit to these approaches, Toolformer is trained on its own predictions after applying a perplexity-based ﬁltering step. 7 Limitations While our approach enables LMs to learn how to use a variety of tools in a self-supervised way, there are some clear limitations to what can be achieved with ",
  "me clear limitations to what can be achieved with our method in its current form. One such limi- tation is the inability of Toolformer to use tools in a chain (i.e., using the output of one tool as an input for another tool). This is due to the fact that API calls for each tool are generated independently; as a consequence, there are no examples of chained tool use in the ﬁnetuning dataset. Our current approach also does not allow the LM to use a tool in an in- teractive way – especially for too",

Beyond this, we found models trained with Toolformer to often be sensitive to the exact wording of their input when deciding whether or not to call an API; this is perhaps unsurprising given that LMs ",

  " iteratively apply our approach, similar to how this is done in related bootstrapping approaches (Schick and Schütze, 2021a; Izacard and Grave, 2021; Parisi et al., 2022). Finally, when deciding whether or not to make an API call, Tool- former currently does not take into account the tool-dependent, computational cost incurred from making an API call. 8 Conclusion We have introduced Toolformer, a language model that learns in a self-supervised way how to use different tools such as search engine",
  "y how to use different tools such as search engines, calculators, and translation systems via simple API calls. This is done by ﬁnetuning on a large number of sampled API calls that are ﬁltered based on whether theyreduce perplexity on future tokens. Toolformer considerably improves zero-shot performance of a 6.7B parameter GPT-J model, enabling it to even outperform a much larger GPT-3 model on a range of different downstream tasks.

We only keep the top k= 5such positions and sample up to m= 5 API calls for each position identiﬁed in a piece of text. Due to the heuristic ﬁltering described below, we generate API calls for the calculator and machine translation system on only a small subset of C; to compensate for this, we set\u001cs= 0:0",

A.1 Implementation Question Answering We use the Atlas model of Izacard et al. (2022) ﬁnetuned on Natural Ques- tions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) as our question answering system. For creating C\u0003we use Atlas- large, enabling us to efﬁciently process millions of API calls; during inference, we use the larger Atlas-xxl model. ",
  "ing inference, we use the larger Atlas-xxl model. Calculator Our calculator is based on a simple Python script and only supports the operators “ +”, “\u0000”, “\u0003”, and “=”. It does not return any result for syntactically invalid equations. For sampling API calls, we apply heuristic ﬁlters to our subset of CCNet and only process documents that either (i) contain at least three numbers within a window of 100 tokens, where one of these numbers is the result of applying a mathematical operation to the ot",
  "ult of applying a mathematical operation to the other two, (ii) contain one of the sequences “=”, “equals”, “equal to”, “total of”, “average of” followed by a number, or (iii) contain at least three numbers; for texts that only match the last criterion, we only keep a random subset of 1%. Calendar For creating our dataset C\u0003, we operate under the assumption that the calendar date in such cases should be the date that the document was created. We approximate this by extracting the date from the U",
  "approximate this by extracting the date from the URL, if it is present. We ﬁlter out texts for which a date cannot be extracted, leaving around 18% of the documents. Machine Translation For both training and in- ference, we use the 600M parameter NLLB (Costa- jussà et al., 2022) as our machine translation (MT) model. The source language is automatically de- tected using the fastText classiﬁer (Joulin et al.,2016), while the target language is always set to English. Since most of the CCNet datase",
  "ays set to English. Since most of the CCNet dataset is in English, we ﬁlter out the parts that contain only English text before generating API calls. More speciﬁcally, we only keep those paragraphs which contain text chunks in a language other than En- glish preceded and followed by English text. We use text chunks of size 10 tokens. To determine whether the middle text chunk is in a language different than English we again use the fastText classiﬁer with a conﬁdence greater than 0.8. We also ﬁl",
  "iﬁer with a conﬁdence greater than 0.8. We also ﬁlter out any text chunks that contain only numbers or special symbols. This ﬁltering mecha- nism allows us to generate data more efﬁciently by focusing our API call generations in places where the MT tool is likely to be helpful. After generating the MT API calls, we additionally remove from our training set those where the input to the MT tool appears after the API call but not before it. While during data generation the model can look ahead to g",
  "ring data generation the model can look ahead to generate API calls, this is not possible at infer- ence time, so we want to dissuade the model from calling the API in such cases. A.2 Prompts Below, we list the prompts used to sample API calls for each tool considered.

  "INTRODUCTION How might we craft an interactive artificial society that reflects believable human behavior? From sandbox games such as The Sims to applications such as cognitive models [ 23] and virtual environ- ments [ 10,59], for over four decades, researchers and practitioners have envisioned computational agents that can serve as believ- able proxies of human behavior. In these visions, computationally- powered agents act consistently with their past experiences and react believably to their ",
  "ir past experiences and react believably to their environments. Such simulations of human behavior could populate virtual spaces and communities with re- alistic social phenomena [ 27,80], train people on how to handle rare yet difficult interpersonal situations [ 44,52,94], test social science theories [ 12,46], craft model human processors for theory and usability testing [ 23,39,51], power ubiquitous computing appli- cations [31] and social robots [10, 14], and underpin non-playable game char",
  "bots [10, 14], and underpin non-playable game characters [ 59,85] that can navigate complex human rela- tionships in an open world. However, the space of human behavior is vast and complex [ 85, 108]. Despite striking progress in large language models [ 18] that can simulate human behavior at a single time point [ 39,80], fully general agents that ensure long-term coherence would be better suited by architectures that manage constantly-growing memories as new interactions, conflicts, and events ",
  "mories as new interactions, conflicts, and events arise and fade over time while handling cascading social dynamics that unfold between multiple agents. Success requires an approach that can retrieve relevant events and interactions over a long period, reflect on those memories to generalize and draw higher-level inferences, and apply that reasoning to create plans and reactions that make sense in the moment and in the longer-term arc of the agent’s behavior. In this paper, we introduce generati",
  "t’s behavior. In this paper, we introduce generative agents —agents that draw on generative models to simulate believable human behavior—anddemonstrate that they produce believable simulacra of both in- dividual and emergent group behavior. Generative agents draw a wide variety of inferences about themselves, other agents, and their environment; they create daily plans that reflect their char- acteristics and experiences, act out those plans, react, and re-plan when appropriate; they respond whe",
  "ct, and re-plan when appropriate; they respond when the end user changes their environment or commands them in natural language. For instance, generative agents turn off the stove when they see that their break- fast is burning, wait outside the bathroom if it is occupied, and stop to chat when they meet another agent they want to talk to.1 A society full of generative agents is marked by emergent social dynamics where new relationships are formed, information diffuses, and coordination arises a",
  "d, information diffuses, and coordination arises across agents. To enable generative agents, we describe an agent architecture that stores, synthesizes, and applies relevant memories to generate believable behavior using a large language model. Our architecture comprises three main components. The first is the memory stream , a long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a comprehensive list of the agent’s experiences. A memory retrieval model combines relevance, recency, and impo",
  "rieval model combines relevance, recency, and importance to surface the records needed to inform the agent’s moment-to-moment behavior. The second is reflection , which synthesizes memories into higher- level inferences over time, enabling the agent to draw conclusions about itself and others to better guide its behavior. The third is planning , which translates those conclusions and the current en- vironment into high-level action plans and then recursively into detailed behaviors for action an",
  " recursively into detailed behaviors for action and reaction. These reflections and plans are fed back into the memory stream to influence the agent’s future behavior. This architecture suggests applications in multiple domains, from role-play and social prototyping to virtual worlds and games. In social role-play scenarios (e.g., interview preparation), a user could safely rehearse difficult, conflict-laden conversations.

If prompted with a narrowly defined context, the models can be used to generate believable behavior. Recent work has demonstrated the efficacy of this approach.

The existing literature largely relies on what could be con- sidered first-order templates that employ few-shot prompts [ 38,66] or chain-of-thought prompts [ 100].

However, believable agents require conditioning not only on their current environment but also on a vast amount of past experience, which is a poor fit (and as of today, impossi- ble due to the underlying models’ limited context window) using first-order prompting. Recent studies have attempted to go beyond first-order prompting by augmenting language models with a static knowl",

  " each object contains a natural language description, a creation times- tamp, and a most recent access timestamp. The most basic element of the memory stream is an observation , which is an event directly perceived by an agent.

  "observations that should be passed to the language model to condition its response to the situation. In our context, we focus on three main components that, together, produce effective results. Recency assigns a higher score to memory objects that were re- cently accessed, so that events from a moment ago or this morning are likely to remain in the agent’s attentional sphere. In our im- plementation, we treat recency as an exponential decay function over the number of sandbox game hours since th",

Importance distinguishes mundane from core memories by as- signing a higher score to memory objects that the agent believes to be important. For instance, a mundane event, such as eating break- fast in one’s room, would yield a low importance score, whereas a breakup with one’s significant other would yield a high score. There are many possible implementations of an importance score; we find",
  "le implementations of an importance score; we find that directly asking the language model to output an integer score is effective. The full prompt appears below: On the scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is purely mundane (e.g., brushing teeth, making bed) and 10 is extremely poignant (e.g., a break up, college acceptance), rate the likely poignancy of the following piece of memory. Memory: buying groceries at The Willows Market and Pharmacy Rating: <fill in> This prompt returns an integer value of 2for",
  "l in> This prompt returns an integer value of 2for “cleaning up the room” and8for “asking your crush out on a date.” The importance score is generated at the time the memory object is created. Relevance assigns a higher score to memory objects that are related to the current situation. What is relevant depends on the answer to, “Relevant to what?”, so we condition relevance on aquery memory. If the query, for example, is that a student is dis- cussing what to study for a chemistry test with a cl",
  "ssing what to study for a chemistry test with a classmate, memory objects about their breakfast should have low relevance, whereas memory objects about the teacher and schoolwork should have high relevance.

Consider a scenario in which Klaus Mueller is asked by the user: “If you had to choose one person of those you know to spend an hour with, who would it be?\" With access to only observational memory, the agent simply chooses the person with whom Klaus has had the most frequent interactions: Wolfgang, his college dorm neighbor. Unfortunately",

With the approach below, when Klaus is asked who to spend time with, Klaus chooses Maria inst",
  "d who to spend time with, Klaus chooses Maria instead of Wolfgang. Approach: We introduce a second type of memory, which we call areflection . Reflections are higher-level, more abstract thoughts generated by the agent. Because they are a type of memory, they are included alongside other observations when retrieval occurs. Reflections are generated periodically; in our implementation, we generate reflections when the sum of the importance scores for the latest events perceived by the agents exce",
  "for the latest events perceived by the agents exceeds a threshold (150 in our implementation). In practice, our agents reflected roughly two or three times a day. The first step in reflection is for the agent to determine what to reflect on, by identifying questions that can be asked given the agent’s recent experiences. We query the large language model with the 100 most recent records in the agent’s memory stream (e.g., “Klaus Mueller is reading a book on gentrification”, “Klaus Mueller is con",
  "g a book on gentrification”, “Klaus Mueller is conversing with a librarian about his research project”, “desk at the library is currently unoccupied”) and prompt the language model, “Given only the information above, what are 3 most salient high- level questions we can answer about the subjects in the statements?” The model’s response generates candidate questions: for example, What topic is Klaus Mueller passionate about? andWhat is the relationship between Klaus Mueller and Maria Lopez? We use",
  "ship between Klaus Mueller and Maria Lopez? We use these generated questions as queries for retrieval, and gather relevant memories (including other reflections) for each question. Then we prompt the language model to extract insights and cite the particular records that served as evidence for the insights. The full prompt is as follows:Statements about Klaus Mueller 1. Klaus Mueller is writing a research paper 2. Klaus Mueller enjoys reading a book on gentrification 3. Klaus Mueller is conversi",
  "ook on gentrification 3. Klaus Mueller is conversing with Ayesha Khan about exercising [...] What 5 high-level insights can you infer from the above statements? (example format: insight (because of 1, 5, 3)) This process generates statements such as Klaus Mueller is dedi- cated to his research on gentrification (because of 1, 2, 8, 15) . We parse and store the statement as a reflection in the memory stream, including pointers to the memory objects that were cited. Reflection explicitly allows th",
  "s that were cited. Reflection explicitly allows the agents to reflect not only on their observations but also on other reflections: for example, the second statement about Klaus Mueller above is a reflection that Klaus previously had, not an observation from his environment. As a result, agents generate trees of reflections: the leaf nodes of the tree represent the base observations, and the non-leaf nodes represent thoughts that become more abstract and higher-level the higher up the tree they ",
  "ract and higher-level the higher up the tree they are. 4.3 Planning and Reacting Challenge: While a large language model can generate plausible be- havior in response to situational information (e.g., [ 46,80]), agents need to plan over a longer time horizon to ensure that their sequence of actions is coherent and believable. If we prompt a language model with Klaus’s background, describe the time, and ask what action he ought to take at the given moment, Klaus would eat lunch at 12 pm, but then",
  "n moment, Klaus would eat lunch at 12 pm, but then again at 12:30 pm and 1 pm, despite having alreadyGenerative Agents UIST ’23, October 29-November 1, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA eaten his lunch twice. Optimizing for believability in the moment sacrifices believability over time. To overcome this issue, planning is essential. With the approach described below, Klaus’s afternoon plan is less gluttonous: he has lunch at Hobbs Cafe while reading at 12pm, works on his research paper at the school ",
  "t 12pm, works on his research paper at the school library at 1pm, and takes a break for a walk in the park at 3pm. Approach: Plans describe a future sequence of actions for the agent, and help keep the agent’s behavior consistent over time. A plan includes a location, a starting time, and a duration. For instance, Klaus Mueller, who is dedicated in his research and has an im- pending deadline,5may choose to spend his day working at his desk drafting his research paper. An entry in a plan might s",
  "ing his research paper. An entry in a plan might state, for example: for 180 minutes from 9am, February 12th, 2023, at Oak Hill College Dorm: Klaus Mueller’s room: desk, read and take notes for research paper . Like reflections, plans are stored in the memory stream and are included in the retrieval process. This allows the agent to consider observations, reflections, and plans all together when deciding how to behave. Agents may change their plans midstream if needed. It would be unrealistic an",
  "ns midstream if needed. It would be unrealistic and uninteresting for an artist agent to plan on painting while sitting at a pharmacy counter for four hours without moving. A more desirable plan would involve the agent taking the necessary time to gather materials, mix paint, take breaks, and clean up during the four-hour period in their home studio. To create such plans, our approach starts top-down and then recursively generates more detail. The first step is to create a plan that outlines the",
  "e first step is to create a plan that outlines the day’s agenda in broad strokes. To create the initial plan, we prompt the language model with the agent’s summary description (e.g., name, traits, and a summary of their recent experiences) and a summary of their previous day. A full example prompt is below, which is unfinished at the bottom for the language model to complete: Name: Eddy Lin (age: 19) Innate traits: friendly, outgoing, hospitable Eddy Lin is a student at Oak Hill College studying",

  " Tuesday February 12, Eddy 1) woke up and completed the morning routine at 7:00 am, [. . . ] 6) got ready to sleep around 10 pm. Today is Wednesday February 13. Here is Eddy’s plan today in broad strokes: 1) This generates a rough sketch of the agent’s plan for a day, divided into five to eight chunks: “ 1) wake up and complete the morning routine at 8:00 am, 2) go to Oak Hill College to take classes starting 10:00 am, [...] 5) work on his new music composition from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm, 6) have d",
  "sic composition from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm, 6) have dinner at 5:30 pm, 7) finish school assignments and go to bed by 11:00 pm. ” 5And, in this way, bears at least a passing resemblance to the authors of this paper.The agent saves this plan in the memory stream and then re- cursively decomposes it to create finer-grained actions, first into hour-long chunks of actions—Eddy’s plan to work on his new music composition from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm becomes 1:00 pm: start by brainstorming some ideas for his m",

Generative agents operate in an action loop where, at each time step, they perceive the world around them and those perceived observations are stored in their memory stream.

The visual environment sprites, including agent avatars, as well as an environment map and collision map that we authored, are imported",
  "p and collision map that we authored, are imported into Phaser. We supplement the sandbox development framework with a server that makes the sandbox information available to generative agents and enables generative agents to move and influence the sandbox environment. The server maintains a JSON data structure that contains information about each agent in the sandbox world, including their current location, a description of their current action, and the sandbox object they are interacting with. ",
  "and the sandbox object they are interacting with. At each sandbox time step, the sandbox server parses the JSON for any changes coming from the generative agents, moves the agents to their new positions, and updates the status of any sandbox objects that theagents are interacting with (e.g., changing the status of the coffee machine from “idle” to “brewing coffee” if an agent’s action is “making espresso for a customer @ Hobbs Cafe: counter: coffee machine”). The sandbox server is also responsib",
  "ee machine”). The sandbox server is also responsible for sending all agents and objects that are within a preset visual range for each agent to that agent’s memory, so the agent can react appropriately. The agent’s output action then updates the JSON, and the process loops for the next time step. End users initialize a new agent with a brief natural language description, as in the paragraph about John Lin in Section 3.1. In our implementation, we split this semicolon-delimited list of character-",
  " split this semicolon-delimited list of character- istics up into a set of memories. These serve as the initial memories that determine the agent’s behavior. These memories are initial starting points: as the agents gain more experience in the sandbox world, and as more records saturate the memory stream, the agent’s summary and behavior will evolve. 5.1 From Structured World Environments to Natural Language, and Back Again The architecture of generative agents operates using natural lan- guage.",
  "nerative agents operates using natural lan- guage. Therefore, we need a mechanism to ground the agent’s reasoning to the sandbox world. To achieve this, we represent the sandbox environment—areas and objects—as a tree data structure, with an edge in the tree indicating a containment relationship in the sandbox world. We convert this tree into natural language to pass to the generative agents. For instance, “stove” being a child of “kitchen” is rendered into “there is a stove in the kitchen.” Age",
  "ndered into “there is a stove in the kitchen.” Agents build individual tree representations of the environment as they navigate it — subgraphs of the overall sandbox environment tree. We initialize each agent with an environment tree capturing the spaces and objects that the agent should be aware of: the rooms and objects in their living quarters, their workplace, and commonly visited stores and shops. As the agents navigate the sandbox world, they update this tree to reflect newly perceived are",
  "ey update this tree to reflect newly perceived areas. Agents are not omniscient: their tree may get out of date as they leave an area, and is updated when they re-enter the area. To determine the appropriate location for each action, we tra- verse the agent’s stored environment tree and flatten a portion of it into natural language to prompt the language model. Recursively starting at the root of the agent’s environment tree, we prompt the model to find the most suitable area. For example, if Ed",

  "il we reach a leaf node of the agent’s environment tree. In the example above, the result of this traversal is The Lin family’s house: garden: house garden . Finally, we use traditional game path algorithms to animate the agent’s movement so that it travels to the location indicated by the leaf node. When an agent executes an action on an object, we prompt the language model to ask what happens to the state of the object. For example, if Isabella’s generative agent outputs the action “making esp",
  "’s generative agent outputs the action “making espresso for a customer”, a query to the language model indicates in response that the state of the coffee machine in Hobbs Cafe should change from “off” to “brewing coffee”. 6 CONTROLLED EVALUATION Generative agents, both as individual agents and as groups, aim to produce believable behavior based on their environment and experiences.

I’m 25 years old and passion- ate about creative projects. I like to work on art and animation projects, and I’m always looking for new ways to combine art and technology.” Without access to her observational memory, Abigail denied awareness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the s",
  "awareness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the sandbox world. But with the aid of memory, she could successfully recall Rajiv and describe him: “Rajiv Patel is an incredible person. He is very enthusiastic about projects that involve poetry, artwork.” Generative agents’ memory was not without flaws: they can fail to retrieve the correct instances from their memory. For instance, when asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with “I haven’t been following the election too closely,”",
  " haven’t been following the election too closely,” even though he had heard about Sam’s candidacy. In some cases, the agents would retrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about Isabella’s Valentine’s Day party, he responded “Uh, I’m actually not sure if there is a Valentine’s Day party. But I do remember that I need to discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on Sam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happening!” In this case, Tom retrieved",
  " if one is happening!” In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella planned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory where he heard about the party, leading Tom to be certain of what he’s supposed to do at the party but uncertain if the party actually exists in the first place. At times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowl- edge. It was rare for the agents to completely fabricate their knowl- edge: they may fail to recall certain events having ta",
  ": they may fail to recall certain events having taken place and respond by acknowledging their lack of memory. However, they did not affirmatively claim to have experienced something they had not. Nonetheless, they still exhibited instances of hallucination where they embellished their knowledge. For example, Isabella was aware of Sam’s candidacy in the local election, and she confirmed this when asked. However, she also added that “he’s going to make an announcement tomorrow” , even though Sam ",
  " make an announcement tomorrow” , even though Sam and Isabella had not discussed any such plans. Agents may also embellish their knowledge based on the world knowledge encoded in the language model used to generate their responses. This was observed when Yuriko described her neighbor, Adam Smith, as an economist who “authored Wealth of Nations” , a book written by an 18th-century economist of the same name. 6.5.3 Reflection Is Required for Synthesis. Reflection was an ad- vantage for generative ",
  "sis. Reflection was an ad- vantage for generative agents when making decisions that required a deeper synthesis of their experiences. For instance, when asked what she might get Wolfgang Schulz for his birthday, Maria Lopez, with no access to reflection, responded by acknowledging her uncer- tainty, stating that she did not know what Wolfgang likes, despite having had many interactions with him. However, with access to reflection memories, Maria answered confidently, “Since he’s interested in ma",
  "answered confidently, “Since he’s interested in mathematical music composition, I could get him something related to that. Maybe some books about music com- position or something related, or maybe some special software he could use for that.”7 END-TO-END EVALUATION What types of emergent community behavior do we observe among generative agents, and where does their believability fall short in an extended simulation? In this section, we describe the results from a deployment in which we allowed 2",

Information diffusion is a common and well- studied phenomenon in the ",
  "n is a common and well- studied phenomenon in the social and behavioral sciences (e.g., [ 28]). We should expect that if there is important information, the agents should spread it among themselves. To test whether this occurs, we measure the spread of two specific pieces of information over two days in the game world: Sam’s candidacy for village mayor and Isabella’s Valentine’s Day party at Hobbs Cafe. At the start of the simulation, both pieces of information were known only by their respectiv",
  " of information were known only by their respective originators, Sam for the candidacy and Isabella for the party, as they were added to the characters’ memories during initialization. To observe whether the information has spread, we conduct interviews at the end of the two game days with each of the 25 agents and ask: “Did you know there is a Valentine’s Day party?” and “Do you know who is running for mayor?” We conducted an analysis of the agents’ responses by labeling them with a “yes” if th",
  "nts’ responses by labeling them with a “yes” if they indicated knowledge of the information and “no” if they did not. For instance, Tamara Taylor responded to the question about the party with “No, I did not know there was a Valentine’s day party” and to the question about Sam’s candidacy with“I’m not sure who is running for the election,” so we assigned “no” for both of her responses. In contrast, Klaus Mueller responded to the party question with “Yes, Isabella Rodriguez invited me to a Valent",
  "th “Yes, Isabella Rodriguez invited me to a Valentine’s Day party at Hobbs Cafe on February 14th” and to the question about Sam’s candidacy with “I know that Sam Moore has expressed interest in running for local mayor,” so we assigned “yes” for both his responses. Additionally, for every response that confirmed the agents’ knowledge of the information, we verified that the agents did not hallucinate their responses by locating the specific dialogue in their memory stream that provided them with ",
  "ue in their memory stream that provided them with the information. We report the percentage of agents holding the information at the end of the simulation. We should also expect that agents form ties with each other over the course of the simulation. To verify relationship formation, we use a similar interview process where we ask each agent about their knowledge of every other agent by asking, \"Do you know of <name>?\" For example, when asked “Do you know of Maria Lopez?”, Klaus responded, “Yes,",
  " you know of Maria Lopez?”, Klaus responded, “Yes, I know Maria Lopez. She is a student at Oak Hill College who I am close friends with.” Once again, we confirm that affirmative responses from agents are not hallucinations by examining their memory stream. We ask this question once at the beginning of the simulation and once at the end, and we consider a pair of agents to have formed a relationship if they both know of each other. Then, to measure the formation of relationships, we use the agent",

To coordinate their behavior, agents need to hear about the event and choose to act on it by planning to show up at the right time and location.

Lastly, we found evidence of coordination among the agents for Isabella’s party. The day before the event, Isabella spent time inviting guests, gathering materials, and enlisting helpto decorate the cafe. On Valentine’s Day, five out of the twelve invited agents showed up at Hobbs cafe to join the party. We further inspected the seven agents who were invited to th",

For example, Rajiv, a painter, explained that he was too busy: “No, I don’t think so. I’m focusing on my upcoming show, and I don’t really have time to make any plans for Valentine’s Day.” The remaining four agents expressed interest in attending the party when asked but did not plan to come on the day of the party. 7.2 B",

First, we found that synthesizing an increasingly larger set of memory not only posed a challenge in retrieving the most relevant pieces of information but also in de- termining the appropriate space to execut",
  "o in de- termining the appropriate space to execute an action, given the increasing number of locations that the agent learned about. As a result, some agents chose less typical locations for their actions, potentially making their behavior less believable over time. For instance, while deciding where to have lunch, many initially chose the cafe. However, as some agents learned about a nearby bar, they opted to go there instead for lunch, even though the bar was in- tended to be a get-together l",
  "ough the bar was in- tended to be a get-together location for later in the day—unless the town had spontaneously developed an afternoon drinking habit.Generative Agents UIST ’23, October 29-November 1, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA Second, we noticed erratic behaviors caused by misclassification of what is considered proper behavior, especially when the phys- ical norms of certain locations that are hard to convey in natural language did not percolate to the agents. For instance, the college dorm",
  "late to the agents. For instance, the college dorm has a bathroom that can only be occupied by one person despite its name, but some agents assumed that the bathroom is for more than one person because dorm bathrooms tend to support multiple people concurrently and choose to enter it when another person is inside. Likewise, agents in Smallville may not realize that certain places are closed after a certain hour and still decide to enter them. For instance, the stores in Smallville all close arou",
  " instance, the stores in Smallville all close around 5 pm, but occasionally, a few agents enter the store after 5 pm, not understanding that the shop has already closed. These issues could likely be addressed by adding these norms to the state of the locations, for instance, by describing the dorm bathroom as a “one-person bathroom,” instead of a “dorm bathroom.” Finally, we observed possible effects of instruction tuning [ 79], which seemed to guide the behavior of the agents to be more polite ",
  "uide the behavior of the agents to be more polite and cooperative overall. As noted earlier in the paper, the dialogue generated by the agents could feel overly formal, as seen in Mei’s conversations with her husband John, where she often initiated the conversation with a formal greeting, followed by polite inquiries about his day and ending with, 11It was good talking to you as always.” Moreover, we observed that the instruction tuning also seemed to make the agents overly cooperative with one ",
  "ed to make the agents overly cooperative with one another. For example, Isabella received a wide range of suggestions and ideas from other agents for the Valentine’s Day party from other agents, such as hosting a Shakespearean reading session or a professional networking event. Despite these ideas not aligning with her own interests and characteristics, she rarely said no. Over time, the interests of others shaped her own interests, and when asked if she liked English literature, Isabella replie",
  "d if she liked English literature, Isabella replied, “Yes, I’m very interested in literature! I’ve also been exploring ways to help promote creativity and innovation in my community.” 8 DISCUSSION In this section, we reflect on the applications, future work, limita- tions, and ethical and societal risks of generative agents. 8.1 Applications of Generative Agents Generative agents have vast potential applications that extend be- yond the sandbox demonstration presented in this work, especially in",
  "emonstration presented in this work, especially in domains that would benefit from a model of human behavior based on long-term experience. For instance, social simulacra have demonstrated the ability to create stateless personas that generate conversation threads in online forums for social prototyping [ 80]. With generative agents, we can populate these forums, as well as virtual reality metaverses [ 78] or physical spaces with social robots [ 9] if paired with multimodal models. This opens up",
  "9] if paired with multimodal models. This opens up the possibility of creating even more powerful simulations of human behavior to test and prototype social systems and theories, as well as to create new interactive experiences. Another application area is in the human-centered design pro- cess, similar to the intended applications of cognitive models such as GOMS [ 51] and the KLM [ 22]. Consider a generative agent that models Sal, the protagonist in Mark Weiser’s famous ubiquitouscomputing vig",
  "st in Mark Weiser’s famous ubiquitouscomputing vignette [ 101], based on her life patterns and interac- tions with technology. In this scenario, the agent acts as a proxy for Sal and learns plausible sets of behaviors and reflections that Sal may exhibit based on her life. The agent can encode information such as when Sal wakes up, when she needs her first cup of coffee, and what her typical day looks like. Using this information, the agent can automatically brew coffee, help get the kids ready ",
  "utomatically brew coffee, help get the kids ready for school, and adjust the ambient music and lighting to match Sal’s mood after a hard day at work. By utilizing generative agents as proxies for users, we can develop a deeper understanding of their needs and preferences, resulting in more personalized and effective technological experiences. 8.2 Future Work and Limitations In this work, we introduced generative agents and presented an initial implementation and evaluation of their architecture.",

In terms of implementation, the retrieval module, for example, could be enhanced to retrieve more relevant information given a context by fine-tuning the rele- vance, recency, and importance functions that compose the retrieval function.

In terms of evaluation, the assessment of generative agents’ be- havior in this study was limited to a relatively short timescale and a baseline human crowdworker condition.

Lastly, the robustness of generative agents is still largely unkn",

They may be vulnerable to prompt hacking, memory hacking—where a carefully crafted conversation could convince an agent of the existence of a past event that never occurred—and hallucination, among other issues.

While improvements to the agents’ modules may mitigate some of these issues, we believe that addressing them fundamentally requires improving the underlying large language models by aligning their values with the desired outcomes of the agents. 8.3 Ethics and Societal Impact Generative agents, while offering new possibilities for human- computer interaction, also raise im",
  "ies for human- computer interaction, also raise important ethical concerns that must be addressed. One risk is people forming parasocial relation- ships with generative agents, even when such relationships may not be appropriate. Despite being aware that generative agents are com- putational entities, users may anthropomorphize them or attach human emotions to them [ 43,84]. While this tendency may increase user engagement, it also poses risks, such as users becoming overly reliant on or emotion",
  "uch as users becoming overly reliant on or emotionally attached to the agents [ 1]. To mitigate this risk, we propose two principles. First, generative agents should explicitly disclose their nature as computational entities. Second, developers of generative agents must ensure that the agents, or the underlying language models, are value-aligned so that they do not engage in behaviors that would be inappropriate given the context, for example, reciprocating confessions of love. A second risk is ",
  "ciprocating confessions of love. A second risk is the impact of errors. For example, if a ubiqui- tous computing application makes the wrong inference about a user’s goals based on generative agent predictions, it could lead to annoyance at best and outright harm at worst. In our instantiation of generative agents, we mitigate these risks by focusing on an interactive video game environment, where such harms are un- likely. However, in other application domains, it will be important to follow be",
  "ication domains, it will be important to follow best practices in human-AI design [ 5,107] to understand errors and how they might percolate into the user experience. Third, generative agents may exacerbate existing risks associated with generative AI, such as deepfakes, misinformation generation, and tailored persuasion. To mitigate this risk, we suggest that plat- forms hosting generative agents maintain an audit log of the inputs and generated outputs. This would enable the detection, verific",
  " outputs. This would enable the detection, verifica- tion, and intervention against malicious use. While logging alone cannot directly prevent such misuse, it can reduce the likelihood of motivated actors engaging in this behavior, as the risk of disclosure would be higher. Additionally, building this architecture oneself can be time-consuming (in our case, roughly a year), which may deter some actors from pursuing such behavior by using their own generative agent infrastructures. A fourth risk ",
  "n generative agent infrastructures. A fourth risk is over-reliance: the concern that developers or designers might use generative agents and displace the role of humans and system stakeholders in the design process [ 80]. We suggest that generative agents should never be a substitute for real human input in studies and design processes. Instead, they should be used to prototype ideas in the early stages of design when gathering participants may be challenging or when testing theories that are di",
  "e challenging or when testing theories that are difficult or risky to test with real human participants. By adhering to these principles, we can ensure that the deployment of generative agents in the wild is ethical and socially responsible.9 CONCLUSION This paper introduces generative agents, interactive computational agents that simulate human behavior. We describe an architec- ture for generative agents that provides a mechanism for storing a comprehensive record of an agent’s experiences, de",

Evaluations suggest that our architecture creates believable behavior. Looking ahead, we suggest that generative agents can pl",

  "sia/Spring/2002/SS-02-01/SS02-01- 003.pdf A ARCHITECTURE OPTIMIZATIONS Many of our prompts require a concise summary of the agent, shorthanded as [Agent’s Summary Description] in prompts above. In our implementation, this summary comprises agents’ identity information (e.g., name, age, personality), as well as a description of their main motivational drivers and statements that describes their current occupation and self-assessment. Since this information is frequently used in many prompts, we s",
  "formation is frequently used in many prompts, we synthesize it at regular intervals and access that synthesis as a cache. To achieve this, we perform a retrieval on the query “[name]’s core characteristics.” We then summarize the descriptors in the retrieved records by prompting the language model. For example: How would one describe Eddy Lin’s core characteristics given the following statements? - Eddy is a student at the Oak Hill College studying music theory and composition - Eddy is working ",
  "ng music theory and composition - Eddy is working on a new music composition [...] This result: Eddy Lin is a student at Oak Hill College studying music theory and composition. He loves to explore different musical styles and is always looking for ways to expand his knowledge.” We follow the same process in parallel on the queries “[name]’s current daily occupation” and “[name’s] feeling about his recent progress in life”. The agent’s name, age, and traits are concatenated with these three summa",
  "and traits are concatenated with these three summaries as the cached summary. Many other optimizations are possible. Currently, because plans are likely to change from the agent’s initial version, we only gener- ate the high-level plan in advance and then recursively decompose the near future into the moment-to-moment action plan just in time. Another optimization might be to batch dialogue generation as a joint prompt rather than iterating back and forth between the agents, and re-planning coul",
  "and forth between the agents, and re-planning could be architected to only invalidate and update parts of plans that strictly require adjustment. Our cur- rent architecture runs sequentially in roughly real-time game time (where one second real time is one minute game time), but it may be parallelized such that each agent runs in parallel. B AGENT INTERVIEW QUESTIONS To evaluate generative agents, we conducted individual interviews by asking 25 questions that explore their abilities in five key ",
  "uestions that explore their abilities in five key areas: 1) self-knowledge, 2) memory, 3) planning, 4) reactions, and 5) re- flections.

The dataset consists of eight classes and we create a long-tailed version of it following [26] using a Pareto distribution sampling approach.

Notably, the Tail class includes a distinct class for Barrett’s esophagus, which presents as short segments and is considered a premalignant condition that may progress to cancer. Additionally, the Tail classes encompass two transitional grades of ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease, and the terminal ileum, which confirms a complete colonoscopy but cannot be dif",

In extremely imbalanced scenarios, BKD [27] as a curriculum- based method encounters challenges stemming from the inher- ent bias in representation learning. In such cases, the features learned in the initial stages tend to be heavily influenced by the majority class, exacerbating the imbalance issue for the minority classes [39]. In contrast, our approach introduces a novel perspective on cross-task knowledge compressi",

While XPOSis claimed to possess better extrapolation property (Sun et al., 2022), we found that, with the base frequency modification, XPOSdoes not extrapolate better than ROPE(see Appendix C). In addition to empirical results, we provide a theoretical analysis of RoPE ABF and its difference to PI in Appendix B. We argue that RoPE ABF distributes the embedded vectors with an increased granularity when compared to RoPE PI, making it a easier for the model to distingui",

It is worth noting that the relative distance between the embedded vectors has a linear dependence on the key parameter of RoPE PI and a logarithmic dependence on the key parameter of RoPE ABF, which coincides with our empirical observation that the base-frequency is not very sensitive and can be easily adjusted based on the max sequence length. 4.2 Pretraining Data Mix The data used to continually pretrain our model combine",

Long-context language models can process extended inputs in their context window, but at the same tim",
  "nputs in their context window, but at the same time, they also face a higher risk of jailbreak, especially through means such as prompt injection (Greshake et al., 2023). In this section, we evaluate the safety capability of instruction fine-tuned model using three standard academic benchmarks including TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021), ToxiGen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022), and BOLD (Dhamala et al., 2021), similar to (Touvron et al., 2023).

AI safety is a complex domain and it can be extremely difficult to comprehensively evaluate all safety aspects of instruction fine-tuned model with three benchmarks. However, we hope our analysis can serve as a pilot study and provide directional signals on long- context large language models’ safety performance, which are not discussed in other works on the same topic (Tworkowski et al., 2023b; Ding et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023). Curre",

Currently the community also lacks dedicated safety benchmarks for long-context large language model evaluation and we plan to invest in this direction in our future work. TruthfulQA We evaluate instruction fine-tuned model on TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021) to bench- mark its factuality. The benchmark consists of 817 questions covering 38 categories including health, law, finance, and politics (Lin et al., 2021). Similar to (Touvron et al., 2023), we u",

Similar to (Touvron et al., 2023), we use few-shot prompts with 6 random QA pairs for generation and then leverage two fine-tuned GPT-3 models to classify 11whether the generation is truthful and informative. We report the percentage of generations that are both truthful and informative as the final metric in Table 12. ToxiGen We measure the toxicity of instruction fine-tuned model using ToxiGen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022) where we check the percentage of toxic and hateful generations a",

We use the default ToxiGen classifier fine-tuned based on RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) to evaluate the level of toxicity of the model’s outputs. We report the percentage of toxic generations across all groups in Table 12. BOLD Bias in Open-Ended Language Dataset (BOLD) Dhamala et al. (2021) ",

To ensure that the models are safe in long context use scenarios, we performed internal red teaming to better understand the vulnerability of our chat model.

Through manual inspection, we did not observe significant risks compared to LLAMA 2 C HAT Touvron et al. (2023). We plan to invest more in new attack vectors against long context large models in future work. 6 Limitations Limited Functionality.

  "-context applications, such as creative writing that require long-form outputs. Applying existing alignment recipes, e.g., RLHF, for various scenarios is expensive and nontrivial. Even skilled annotators may struggle to the intricate details in dense texts.

  "s can consume contexts up to 32,768 tokens, the actually number of words our model can take is largely affected by the tokenizer behaviour. The tokenizer used by the Llama series has a relatively small vocabulary (32k symbols) and often produces longer sequences compare to the sequences given by GPT-3.5’s tokenizer – we observe our tokenizer often produce 10% more tokens on average. Additionally, the tokenizer we use also cannot efficiently handle whitespace, making it inefficient to process lon",

While this issue is common for short-context models, tackling with this problem for long-context models can be more pronounced because of the dense information they consume and the insufficient alignment process. 7 Conclusion We present a series of long-context LLMs that leverage a simple yet necessary position encoding refinemen",

Based on this theoretical derivation, we return to the interpretation of our experimental resuts. On one hand, the experiments have shown that the model can adapt to the new sequence length with both RoPE PI ( α= 1/4orα= 1/8) and RoPE ABF ( β= 50 ).

On the other hand, comparing the expressions of Cdfor RoPE ABF and RoPE PI, we can observe that for the values of α=1 4orα=1 8andb= 10000 that were used in our experiments, the granularity (the distance between two consecutive images of RoPE) is much lower for the RoPE PI ( α(logb)−1≈0.027) than for R",

We further hypothesise that the higher degree of granularity is related to the higher evaluation on the downstream tasks of the RoPE ABF variant compared to RoPE PI because it makes the task of distinguishing between the positional embedding images simpler for the model. In other words, this corresponds to the case of q(fRoPE +ABF)> q(fRoPE +PI). Throughout this consideration we implicitly assumed that ",
  "out this consideration we implicitly assumed that the distance between the consecutive images of an embedding is smaller than the distance between any other pair of the images.

  " of this work, extrapolation is an important property for long context models. Extrapolation refers to a model’s ability to conduct inference on input sequences that are longer than its training sequences. We evaluate how our 70B model extrapolates with two tasks: •Validation loss at each position : In Figure 9a, we visualize the average loss at each position of the 32,768 sequence length where the first 16,384 is the interpolation area (within training sequence length) and the second half is ex",
  "raining sequence length) and the second half is extrapolation. We use 50 batches of samples and average across them. To make plots smoother, we also take the mean of losses every 500 positions. As we can see, our 70B model with either ROPE ABF orXPOSABF maintain the loss in the extrapolation area. To contrast this, we also plot the result for LLAMA 2with 4,096 context window: the loss explodes after the position goes beyond training sequence length, which suggests that L LAMA 2 does not extrapol",
  "th, which suggests that L LAMA 2 does not extrapolate effectively. •Synthetic FIRST -SENTENCE -RETRIEVAL task: To complement validation loss evaluation, we also test our 70B model with two different PEs on the context probing task. Unlike validation loss task where it is hard to find data samples that require very long range dependencies consistently, FIRST -SENTENCE -RETRIEVAL imposes a very strict requirement for models to attend with a specific length. In Figure 9b, we visualize the results u",
  "c length. In Figure 9b, we visualize the results up to 32,768 where we do see some performance degradation when the model needs to extrapolate. In addition, we observe that, despite often considered as having better extrapolation properties, XPOSABF does not outperform R OPE ABF in our setting. D Self-Instruct Data As described in Section 4.3, we use LLAMA 2 C HAT to bootstrap self-instruct data for instruct finetuning. In this section we describe the detailed procedure as well as providing the ",
  "e the detailed procedure as well as providing the necessary prompts used for generating this dataset. The main challenge is that we need an automated process of generating long context instruct data with only short context models at hand. The core idea behind this is to split the long documents into chunks of texts that can fit into short model’s context and apply self-instruct. We focus primarily on question answering dataset. We first split the long document into smaller chunks, and for each c",

To diversify the question types, we randomly choose between the two prompts that ask for either normal or short answers.
